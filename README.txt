NLTK: 3.6.5


## Runtime
When I first got this working, it used to take about 12s to run the recogniser,
but now that it's checking counts, it suddenly takes several minutes to run?
    Most recent run was 7m41s
Not sure what changed...
Sorry :-\

Thanks, and be sure to have yourself a damn fine day!
